<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>I am Asahi Nago. I am an international student from Japan, and studying Quantitative Economics(Economics and Mathematics) with a secondary emphasis in Data Science. I was born in a small island in Japan called Okinawa, but I raised in many different cities including Tokyo. I went to an international school where I had to study many subjects both in Japanese and English from 8th grade. I started learning English after I joined my junior high school. I can speak both Japanese and English, and happy that I am a bilingual. Also, I was living in Vietnam for a year and half. <br>
I used to participate in cross-country team and run for the conference in all international school in Japan. I am a huge fan of baseball and soccer. My favorite team is Yomiuri Giants and Vissel Kobe in Japan. Losangels Dodgers and Manchester United are my favorite team outside of Japan.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>I want to become a </i></span><span class="s2"><i>Data Scientist</i></span><span class="s1"><i> in the future, and hope to work in the US. I am learning python, R, SQL, html, and JavaScript this semester, and hope to get an internship where I can perform my knowledge into the actual workspace. I am considering living in the US since Japan is not an ideal place for me to live in the future. The reason is that the GDP in Japan is lower that the US. This means that the companies don't pay well for employees, and hard to increase the quality of life for some people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>I decided to study abroad specifially in the US after I reached 10th grade. I wanted to study abroad because that way, it would be perfect for me to use English in the both academics and life. Living in Japan is a perfect way to live. However, I wanted to go over the challenging path so that I can acquire knowledge that I am passionate about. I love to challenge new things, because it provides me a new point of view that would be benefial for me in some way in the future. I enjoyed living in the US and studying. It gives me the stimulation that I want to do more and find someone that can motivate me academics. I appreciate all the surroundings, environment, and atmosphere that enables me to study abroad in the US including my freinds, professors, and especially my family. I would hope to gain something meaningful to live in the future and give back the experience to the society.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
